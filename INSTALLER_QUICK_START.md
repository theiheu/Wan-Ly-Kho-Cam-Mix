# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Professional Windows Installer

## ✅ Fixed Requirements Issue

The `upx-ucl` requirement has been fixed! The build system now works without UPX and will automatically detect and use UPX if it's available for better compression.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+** with pip
2. **Administrator privileges** (for installer testing)
3. **Windows 10/11** (64-bit)

## 🔧 Installation Steps

### 1. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "C:\Users\thehi\OneDrive\文档\SourceCode\Minh-Tan_Phat\Wan_Ly_Kho_Cam_Mix-3.3"

# Install build requirements (this should work now!)
pip install -r requirements-build.txt
```

### 2. Build the Professional Installer
```bash
# Navigate to installer build directory
cd installer\build

# Run the complete build system
python build_installer.py
```

## 📦 What You'll Get

After the build completes, you'll find in `installer/output/`:

1. **`ChickenFarmManager.exe`** - Your main application
2. **`ChickenFarmManager_Setup.exe`** - Professional NSIS/Inno Setup installer
3. **`install.bat`** - Advanced batch installer with all features
4. **`ChickenFarmManager_v2.0.0_Professional_Distribution.zip`** - Complete distribution package

## 🎯 Testing Your Installer

### Quick Test
```bash
# Validate the installers
cd ..\scripts
python validate_installer.py
```

### Manual Test
1. **Right-click** on `ChickenFarmManager_Setup.exe`
2. **Select "Run as administrator"**
3. **Follow the installation wizard**
4. **Verify** the application appears in Start Menu and Add/Remove Programs

## 🔧 Optional Enhancements

### UPX Compression (Optional)
For smaller executable files:
1. Download UPX from https://upx.github.io/
2. Extract and add to your PATH
3. Rebuild - UPX will be automatically detected and used

### Code Signing (For Production)
```bash
# Create signing configuration
python ..\scripts\sign_installer.py config

# Edit installer\scripts\signing_config.json with your certificate details

# Sign the installers
python ..\scripts\sign_installer.py sign
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" errors
- Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- Disable antivirus temporarily during build

### "PyInstaller failed" errors
- Ensure all source files are present
- Check that virtual environment is activated
- Verify Python version is 3.8+

### Build succeeds but installer doesn't work
- Run the validation system: `python validate_installer.py`
- Check the build logs for warnings
- Test on a clean Windows system
